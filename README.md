# Overview

The data set that I am working with is streaming viewership data. This includes information gathered from viewers to show information on their viewing session.
Lists of columns and the data set can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/code/maxim9012/streaming-application-viewership

With the increasing amount of streaming services and the number of devices that are supported. I wanted to know how long people watch in a single session,
the favorite genre by country, and if there is a difference in genre watched between male and female. This program was created to analyze an calculate that information
